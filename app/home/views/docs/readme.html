<h1>Volt</h1>

<p>NOTE: VOLT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, DON&#39;T USE IT FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS YET</p>

<p>Volt is a ruby web framework where your ruby code runs on both the server and the client (via <a href="https://github.com/opal/opal">opal</a>.)  The dom automatically update as the user interacts with the page.  Page state can be stored in the url, if the user hits a url directly, the HTML will first be rendered on the server for faster load times and easier indexing by search engines.</p>

<p>Instead of syncing data between the client and server via HTTP, volt uses a persistent connection between the client and server.  When data updated on one client, it is updated in the database and any other listening clients.  (With almost no setup code needed)</p>

<p>Pages HTML is written in a handlebars like template language.  Volt uses data flow/reactive programming to automatically and intellegently propigate changes to the dom (or anything other code wanting to know when a value updates)  When something in the dom changes, Volt intellegent updates only the nodes that need to be changed.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>Volt has the following goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>Developer happieness</li>
<li>Write once on the client and the server</li>
<li>Automatic data syncing between client and server</li>
<li>Apps are built as nested components.  Components can be shared (via gems)</li>
<li>Concurrent.  Volt provides tools to simplify concurrency.  Component rendering is done in parallel on the server.</li>
<li>Intellegent asset management</li>
<li>Secure (shouldn&#39;t need to be said, but it does)</li>
<li>Be fast/light</li>
<li>Understandable code base</li>
<li>Control Upgradeability</li>
</ol>

<h1>Road Map</h1>

<p>Many of the core Volt features are implemented.  We still have a bit to go before 1.0, most of it involving models.</p>

<ol>
<li>Database storing models</li>
<li>Model validations (client and server side)</li>
<li>Reactive model queries</li>
<li>Reactive Enumerators with Blocks (.map .count, etc...)</li>
<li>Full managed render loop (for fast rendering)</li>
<li>Fix N+1 issue with some reactive values (I know how to fix, just haven&#39;t gotten around to doing it)</li>
</ol>

<h1>VOLT guide</h1>

<p>This guide will take you through creating a basic web application in Volt.  This tutorial assumes a basic knowledge of ruby and web development.</p>

<p>To get started, install volt:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>gem install volt
</code></pre>

<p>Then create a new project:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>volt new project_name
</code></pre>

<p>This will setup a basic project.  Now lets run the server.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>volt server
</code></pre>

<p>You can access the volt console with:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>volt console
</code></pre>

<h1>Rendering</h1>

<p>When a user interacts with a web page, typically we want to do two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change application state</li>
<li>Update the DOM</li>
</ol>

<p>For example when a user clicks to add a new todo item to a todo list, we might create a JavaScript object to represent the todo item, then add an item to the list&#39;s DOM.  A lot of work needs to be done to make sure that the JavaScript object and the DOM always stay in sync.</p>

<p>Recently the idea of &quot;reactive programming&quot; has been used to simplify maintaining the DOM.  The idea is instead of having event handlers that manage a model (or JavaScript object) and manage the DOM, we have event handlers that manage reactive data models.  We describe our DOM layer in a declarative way so that it automatically knows how to render our data models.</p>

<h2>Reactive Value&#39;s</h2>

<p>To build bindings, Volt provides the ReactiveValue class.  This wraps any object in a reactive interface.  To create a ReactiveValue, simply pass the object you want to wrap as the first argument to new.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    a = ReactiveValue.new(&quot;my object&quot;)
    # =&gt; @&quot;my object&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>When .inspect is called on a ReactiveValue (like in the console), an @ is placed infront of the value&#39;s inspect string, so you know its reactive.</p>

<p>When you call a method on a ReactiveValue, you get back a new reactive value that depends on the previous one.  It remebers how it was created and you can call .cur on it any time to get its current value, which will be computed based off of the first reactive value.  (Keep in mind below that + is a method call, the same as a.+(b) in ruby.)</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    a = ReactiveValue.new(1)
    a.reactive?
    # =&gt; true

    a.cur
    # =&gt; 1

    b = a + 5
    b.reactive?
    # =&gt; true

    b.cur
    # =&gt; 6

    a.cur = 2
    b.cur
    # =&gt; 7
</code></pre>

<p>This provides the backbone for reactive programming.  We setup computation/flow graphs instead of doing an actual calcuation.  Calling .cur (or .inspect, .to_s, etc..) runs the computation and returns the current value at that time, based on all of its dependencies.</p>

<p>ReactiveValue&#39;s also let you setup listeners and trigger events:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    a = ReactiveValue.new(0)
    a.on(&#39;changed&#39;) {"&#123;"} puts &quot;A changed&quot; {38.chr + "#125;"}
    a.trigger!(&#39;changed&#39;)
    # =&gt; A Changed
</code></pre>

<p>These events propigate to any reactive value&#39;s created off of a reactive value.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    a = ReactiveValue.new(1)
    b = a + 5
    b.on(&#39;changed&#39;) {"&#123;"} puts &quot;B changed&quot; {38.chr + "#125;"}

    a.trigger!(&#39;changed&#39;)
    # =&gt; B changed
</code></pre>

<p>This event flow lets us know when an object has changed, so we can update everything that depended on that object.</p>

<p>Lastly, we can also pass in other reactive value&#39;s as arguments to methods on a reactive value.  The dependencies will be tracked for both and events will propigate down from both.  (Also, note that doing .cur = to update the current value triggers a &quot;changed&quot; event.)</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    a = ReactiveValue.new(1)
    b = ReactiveValue.new(2)
    c = a + b

    a.on(&#39;changed&#39;) {"&#123;"} puts &quot;A changed&quot; {38.chr + "#125;"}
    b.on(&#39;changed&#39;) {"&#123;"} puts &quot;B changed&quot; {38.chr + "#125;"}
    c.on(&#39;changed&#39;) {"&#123;"} puts &quot;C changed&quot; {38.chr + "#125;"}

    a.cur = 3
    # =&gt; A changed
    # =&gt; C changed

    b.cur = 5
    # =&gt; B changed
    # =&gt; C changed
</code></pre>

<h3>ReactiveValue Gotchya&#39;s</h3>

<p>There are a few simple things to keep in mind with ReactiveValue&#39;s.  In order to make them mostly compatible with other ruby objects, a two methods do not return another ReactiveValue.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>to_s and inspect
</code></pre>

<p>If you want these to be used reactively, see the section on <a href="#with">with</a></p>

<p>Also, due to a small limitation in ruby, ReactiveValue&#39;s always are truthy.  See the <a href="#truthy-checks-true-false-or-and-and">truthy checks</a> section on how to check for truth.</p>

<h3>Current Status</h3>

<p>NOTE: currently ReactiveValue&#39;s are not complete.  At the moment, they do not handle methods that are passed blocks (or procs, lambda&#39;s).  This is planned, but not complete.  At the moment you can use <a href="#with">with</a> to accomplish similar things.</p>

<h3>Truthy Checks: .true?, .false?, .or, and .and</h3>

<p>Because a method on a reactive value always returns another reactive value, and because only nil and false are false in ruby, we need a way to check if a ReactiveValue is truthy in our code.  The easiest way to do this is by calling .true? on it.  It will return a non-wrapped boolean.  .nil? and .false? do as you would expect.</p>

<p>One common place we use a truthy check is in setting up default values with || (logical or)  Volt provides a convience method that does the same thing .or, but works with ReactiveValue&#39;s.</p>

<p>Instead of </p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    a || b
</code></pre>

<p>Simply use:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    a.or(b)
</code></pre>

<p>.and works the same way as &amp;&amp;.  #and and #or let you maintain the reactivity all of the way through.</p>

<h3>With</h3>

<p>Normally when you want to have a value that depends on another value, but transforms it somehow, you simply call your transform method on the ReactiveValue.  However sometimes the transform is not directly on the ReactiveValue&#39;s object.</p>

<p>You can call .with on any ReactiveValue.  .with will return a new ReactiveValue that depends on the current ReactiveValue.  .with takes a block, the first argument to the block will be the cur value of the ReactiveValue you called with on.  Any additional arguments to with will be passed in after the first one.  If you pass another ReactiveValue as an argument to .with, the returned ReactiveValue will depend on the argument ReactiveValue as well, and the block will receive the arguments cur value.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    a = ReactiveValue.new(5)
    b = a.with {"&#123;"}|v| v + 10 {38.chr + "#125;"}
    b.cur
    # =&gt; 15
</code></pre>

<h2>Bindings</h2>

<p>Now that you understand the basics of ReactiveValue&#39;s, we can discuss bindings.  In Volt, you code your views in a handlebar&#39;s like template language.  Volt provides severial bindings, which handle rendering of something for you.  Content bindings are anything inbetween {"&#123;"} and {38.chr + "#125;"}</p>

<h3>Content binding</h3>

<p>The most basic binding is a content binding:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>&lt;p&gt;{"&#123;"}some_method{38.chr + "#125;"}&lt;p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The content binding runs the ruby code between {"&#123;"} and {38.chr + "#125;"}, then renders the return value.  If the returned value is a ReactiveValue, it will update the value updated whenever a &#39;changed&#39; event is called.</p>

<h3>If binding</h3>

<p>An if binding lets you provide basic flow control.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>{"&#123;"}#if _some_check?{38.chr + "#125;"}
  &lt;p&gt;render this&lt;/p&gt;
{"&#123;"}/{38.chr + "#125;"}
</code></pre>

<p>Blocks are closed with a {"&#123;"}/{38.chr + "#125;"}</p>

<p>When the #if binding is rendered, it will run the ruby code after #if.  If the code is true it will render the code below.  Again, if the returned value is reactive, it will update as that value changes.</p>

<p>If bindings can also have #elsif and #else blocks.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>{"&#123;"}#if _condition_1?{38.chr + "#125;"}
  &lt;p&gt;condition 1 true&lt;/p&gt;
{"&#123;"}#elsif _condition_2?{38.chr + "#125;"}
  &lt;p&gt;condition 2 true&lt;/p&gt;
{"&#123;"}#else{38.chr + "#125;"}
  &lt;p&gt;neither true&lt;/p&gt;
{"&#123;"}/{38.chr + "#125;"}
</code></pre>

<h3>Each binding</h3>

<p>For iteration over objects, the each binding is provided.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>{"&#123;"}#each _items as item{38.chr + "#125;"}
  &lt;p&gt;{"&#123;"}item{38.chr + "#125;"}&lt;/p&gt;
{"&#123;"}/{38.chr + "#125;"}
</code></pre>

<p>Above, if _items was an array, the block would be rendered for each item, setting &#39;item&#39; to the value of the array element.</p>

<p>You can also access the position of the item in the array with the #index method.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>{"&#123;"}#each _items as item{38.chr + "#125;"}
  &lt;p&gt;{"&#123;"}index{38.chr + "#125;"}. {"&#123;"}item{38.chr + "#125;"}&lt;/p&gt;
{"&#123;"}/{38.chr + "#125;"}
</code></pre>

<p>For the array: [&#39;one&#39;, &#39;two&#39;, &#39;three&#39;] this would print:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>0. one
1. two
2. three
</code></pre>

<p>You can do {"&#123;"}index + 1{38.chr + "#125;"} to correct the numbers.</p>

<p>When items are removed or added to the array, the #each binding automatically and intellegently add or removes the items from/to the dom.</p>

<h2>Attribute Bindings</h2>

<p>Bindings can also be placed inside of attributes.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>&lt;p class=&quot;{"&#123;"}#if _is_cool?{38.chr + "#125;"}cool{"&#123;"}/{38.chr + "#125;"}&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There are some special features provided to make for elements work as &quot;two way bindings&quot;</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; value=&quot;{"&#123;"}_name{38.chr + "#125;"}&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, if _name changes, the field will update and if the field is updated, _name will be changed.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;{"&#123;"}_checked{38.chr + "#125;"}&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the value of a checked attribute is true, the checkbox will be shown checked.  If it is checked/unchecked, the value will be updated to true or false.</p>

<p>-- TODO: select boxes</p>

<p>If you have a controller at app/home/controller/index_controller.rb, and a view at app/home/views/index/index.html, all methods called are called on the controller.</p>

<h1>Models</h1>

<p>Volt&#39;s concept of a model is slightly different from many frameworks where a model is the name for the ORM to the database.  In Volt a model is a class where you can store data easily.  Where that data stored is not the concern of the model, but the class that created the model.  Lets first see how to use a model.</p>

<p>Volt comes with many built-in models, one is called &#39;page&#39;.  If you call #page on a controller, you will get access to the model.  Models provided by Volt are automatically wrapped in a ReactiveValue.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    page._name = &#39;Ryan&#39;
    page._name
    # =&gt; @&#39;Ryan&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>Models act like a hash that you can access with getters and setters that start with an _  Prefixing with an underscore makes sure we don&#39;t accidentally try to call a method that doesn&#39;t exist and get back nil.  There is no need to define which fields a model has, they act similar to a hash, but with a shorter access and assign syntax.</p>

<p>Models also let you nest data:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    page._settings._color = &#39;blue&#39;
    page._settings._color
    # =&gt; @&#39;blue&#39;

    page._settings
    # =&gt; @#&lt;Model:_settings {"&#123;"}:_color=&gt;&quot;blue&quot;{38.chr + "#125;"}&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Nested data is automatically setup when assigned.  In this case, page._settings is a model that is part of the page model.</p>

<p>You can also append to a model if its not defined yet.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    page._items &lt;&lt; &#39;item 1&#39;
    page._items
    # =&gt; @#&lt;ArrayModel [&quot;item 1&quot;, &quot;item 2&quot;]&gt;

    page._items[0]
    # =&gt; @&quot;item 1&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>An array model will automatically be setup to contain the items appended.</p>

<h2>Provided Collections</h2>

<p>Above I mentioned that Volt comes with many default collection models accessable from a controller.  Each stores in a different location.</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Storage Location</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>page</td>
<td>page provides a temporary store that only lasts for the life of the page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>store</td>
<td>store syncs the data to the backend database and provides query methods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>session</td>
<td>values will be stored in a session cookie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>params</td>
<td>values will be stored in the params and url.  Routes can be setup to change how params are shown in the url.  (See routes for more info)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>flash</td>
<td>any strings assigned will be shown at the top of the page and cleared as the user navigates between pages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>controller</td>
<td>a model for the current controller</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><strong>more storage locations are planned</strong></p>

<h2>Reactive Models</h2>

<p>Because all models provided by Volt are wrapped in a ReactiveValue, you can register listeners on them and be updated when values change.  You can also call methods on their values and get updates when the source&#39;s change.  Bindings also setup listeners.  Models should be the main place you store all data in Volt.  While you can use ReactiveValue&#39;s manually, most of the time you will want to just use something like the page model.</p>

<h2>Model Events</h2>

<p>Models trigger events when their data is updated.  Currently models emit three events: changed, added, and removed.  For example:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    model = Model.new

    model._name.on(&#39;changed&#39;) {"&#123;"} puts &#39;name changed&#39; {38.chr + "#125;"}
    model._name = &#39;Ryan&#39;
    # =&gt; name changed

    model._items.on(&#39;added&#39;) {"&#123;"} puts &#39;item added&#39; {38.chr + "#125;"}
    model._items &lt;&lt; 1
    # =&gt; item added

    model._items.on(&#39;removed&#39;) {"&#123;"} puts &#39;item removed&#39; {38.chr + "#125;"}
    model._items.delete_at(0)
    # =&gt; item removed
</code></pre>

<h2>Automatic Model Conversion</h2>

<h3>Hash -&gt; Model</h3>

<p>For convience, when placing a hash inside of another model, it is automatically converted into a model.  Models are similar to hashes, but provide support for things like persistance and triggering reactive events.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    user = Model.new
    user._name = &#39;Ryan&#39;
    user._profiles = {"&#123;"}
      twitter: &#39;http://www.twitter.com/ryanstout&#39;,
      dribbble: &#39;http://dribbble.com/ryanstout&#39;
    {38.chr + "#125;"}

    user._name
    # =&gt; &quot;Ryan&quot;
    user._profiles._twitter
    # =&gt; &quot;http://www.twitter.com/ryanstout&quot;
    user._profiles.class
    # =&gt; Model
</code></pre>

<p>Models are accessed differently from hashes.  Instead of using model[:symbol] to access, you call a method model.method_name.  This provides a dynamic unified store where setters and getters can be added without changing any access code.</p>

<p>You can get a ruby hash back out by calling .to_h on a Model.</p>

<h3>Array -&gt; ArrayModel</h3>

<p>Arrays inside of models are automatically converted to an instance of ArrayModel.  ArrayModels behave the same as a normal Array except that they can handle things like being bound to backend data and triggering reactive events.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    model = Model.new
    model._items &lt;&lt; {"&#123;"}_name: &#39;item 1&#39;{38.chr + "#125;"}
    model._items.class
    # =&gt; ArrayModel

    model._items[0].class
    # =&gt; Model
    model._items[0]
</code></pre>

<p>To convert a Model or an ArrayModel back to a normal hash, call .to_h or .to_a respectively.  To convert them to a JavaScript Object (for passing to some JavaScript code), call .to_n (to native).</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    user = Model.new
    user._name = &#39;Ryan&#39;
    user._profiles = {"&#123;"}
      twitter: &#39;http://www.twitter.com/ryanstout&#39;,
      dribbble: &#39;http://dribbble.com/ryanstout&#39;
    {38.chr + "#125;"}

    user._profiles.to_h
    # =&gt; {"&#123;"}twitter: &#39;http://www.twitter.com/ryanstout&#39;, dribbble: &#39;http://dribbble.com/ryanstout&#39;{38.chr + "#125;"}

    items = ArrayModel.new([1,2,3,4])
    items
</code></pre>

<p>You can get a normal array again by calling .to_a on an ArrayModel.</p>

<h1>Controllers</h1>

<p>A controller can be any class in Volt, however it is common to have that class inherit from ModelController.  A model controller lets you specify a model that the controller works off of.  This is a common pattern in Volt.  To assign the current model for a controller, simply call the model method passing in one of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>A symbol representing the name of a provided collection model:</li>
</ol>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    class TodosController &lt; ModelController
      model :page

      # ...
    end
</code></pre>

<p>This can also be done at anytime on the controller instance:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    class TodosController &lt; ModelController
      def initialize
        model :page
      end
    end
</code></pre>

<p>See the <a href="#provided-collections">provided collections</a> section for a list of the available collection models.</p>

<p>You can also provide your own object to model.</p>

<p>Now any methods not defined on the TodosController will fall through to the provided model.  All views in views/{"&#123;"}controller_name{38.chr + "#125;"} will have this controller as the target for any ruby run in their bindings.  This means that calls on self (implicit or with self.) will have the model as their target (after calling through the controller).  This lets you add methods to the controller to control how the model is handled.</p>

<p>Controllers in the app/home component do not need to be namespaced, all other components should namespace controllers like so:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    module Auth
      class LoginController &lt; ModelController
        # ...
      end
    end
</code></pre>

<p>Here &quot;auth&quot; would be the component name.</p>

<h1>Components</h1>

<p>Apps are made up of Components.  Each folder under app/ is a component.  When you visit a route, it loads all of the files in the component on the front end, so new pages within the component can be rendered on the front end.  If a url is visited that routes to a different component, the request will be loaded as a normal page load and all of that components files will be loaded.  You can think of components as the &quot;reload boundry&quot; between sections of your app.</p>

<p>You can also use controls (see below) from one component in another.  To do this, you must require the component from the component you wish to use them.  This can be done in the <code>config/dependencies.rb</code> file.  Just put</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    component &#39;component_name&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>in the file.</p>

<p>Dependencies act just like require in ruby, but for whole components.</p>

<p>Sometimes you may need to include an externally hosted JS file from a component.  To do this, simply do the following in the dependencies.rb file:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    javascript_file &#39;http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js&#39;
    css_file &#39;//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.3/css/bootstrap.min.css&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>Note above though that jquery and bootstrap are currently included by default.  Using javascript_file and css_file will be mixed in with your component assets at the correct locations according to the order they occur in the dependencies.rb files.</p>

<h2>Assets</h2>

<p><strong>Note, asset management is still early, and likely will change quite a bit</strong></p>

<p>In volt, assets such as JavaScript and CSS (or sass) are automatically included on the page for you.  Anything placed inside of a components asset folder is served at /assets (via <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets">Sprockets</a>)  Link and script tags are automatically added for each css and js file in assets/css and assets/js respectively.  Files are included in their lexical order, so you can add numbers in front if you need to change the load order.</p>

<p>Any JS/CSS from an included component or component gem will be included as well.  By default <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> is provided by the volt-bootstrap gem.</p>

<h2>Component Generator</h2>

<p>Components can easily be shared as a gem.  Volt provides a scaffold for component gems.  In a folder (not in a volt project), simply type: volt gem {"&#123;"}component_name{38.chr + "#125;"}  This will create the files needed for the gem.  Note that all volt component gems will be prefixed with volt- so they can easily be found by others.</p>

<p>While developing, you can use the component by placing the following in your Gemfile:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>gem &#39;volt-{"&#123;"}component_name{38.chr + "#125;"}&#39;, path: &#39;/path/to/folder/with/component&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>Once the gem is ready, you can release it to ruby gems with:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>rake release
</code></pre>

<p>Remove the path: option in the gemfile if you wish to use the rubygems version.</p>

<h2>Provided Components</h2>

<p>Volt provides a few components to make web developers lives easier.</p>

<h3>Notices</h3>

<p>Volt automatically places <code>&lt;:volt:notices /&gt;</code> into views.  This shows notices for the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>flash messages</li>
<li>connection status (when a disconnect happens, lets the user know why and when a reconnect will be attempted)</li>
<li>page reloading notices (in development)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Flash</h3>

<p>As part of the notices component explained above, you can append messages to any collection on the flash model.</p>

<p>Each collection represents a different type of &quot;flash&quot;.  Common examples are <code>_notices, _warnings, and _errors</code>  Using different collections allows you to change how you want the flash displayed.  For example, you might want <code>_notices</code> and <code>_errors</code> to show with different colors. </p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    flash._notices &lt;&lt; &quot;message to flash&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>These messages will show for 5 seconds, then disappear (both from the screen and the collection). </p>

<h1>Controls</h1>

<p>Everyone wishes that we could predict the scope and required features for each part of our application, but in the real world, things we don&#39;t expect to grow large often do and things we think will be large don&#39;t end up that way.  Controls let you quickly setup reusable code/views.  The location of the control&#39;s code can be moved as it grows without changing the way controls are invoked.</p>

<p>To render a control, simply use a tag like so:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    &lt;:control-name /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    &lt;:control-name&gt;&lt;/:control-name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To find the control&#39;s views and optional controller, Volt will search the following (in order):</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Component</th>
<th>View Folder</th>
<th>View File</th>
<th>Section</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>:{"&#123;"}name{38.chr + "#125;"}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>{"&#123;"}name{38.chr + "#125;"}.html</td>
<td>:body</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>{"&#123;"}name{38.chr + "#125;"}</td>
<td>index.html</td>
<td>:body</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{"&#123;"}name{38.chr + "#125;"}</td>
<td>index</td>
<td>index.html</td>
<td>:body</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>gems/{"&#123;"}name{38.chr + "#125;"}</td>
<td>index</td>
<td>index.html</td>
<td>:body</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><strong>Note that anything with a view folder will also load a controller if the name/folder matches.</strong></p>

<p>Each part is explained below:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>section
Views are composed of sections.  Sections start with a <code>&lt;:SectionName&gt;</code> tag and end with <code>&lt;/:SectionName&gt;</code>  Volt will look first for a section in the same view.</p></li>
<li><p>views
Next Volt will look for a view file that with the control name.  If found, it will render the body section of that view.</p></li>
<li><p>view folder
Failing above, Volt will look for a view folder with the control name, and an index.html file within that folder.  It will render the :body section of that view.  If a controller exists for the view folder, it will make a new instance of that controller and render in that instance.</p></li>
<li><p>component
Next, all folders under app/ are checked.  The view path looked for is {"&#123;"}component{38.chr + "#125;"}/index/index.html with a section of :body.</p></li>
<li><p>gems
Lastly the app folder of all gems that start with volt are checked.  They are checekd for a similar path to component.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When you create a control, you can also specify multiple parts of the search path in the name.  The parts should be seperated by a :  Example:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    &lt;:blog:comments /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The above would search the following:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Component</th>
<th>View Folder</th>
<th>View File</th>
<th>Section</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>blog.html</td>
<td>:comments</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>blog</td>
<td>comments.html</td>
<td>:body</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>blog</td>
<td>comments</td>
<td>index.html</td>
<td>:body</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>gems/blog</td>
<td>comments</td>
<td>index.html</td>
<td>:body</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<h1>Routes</h1>

<p>Routes in Volt are very different from traditional backend frameworks.  Since data is synchronized using websockets, routes are mainly used to serialize the state of the application in a pretty way.  When a page is first loaded, the url is parsed with the routes and the params model&#39;s values are set from the url.  Later if the params model is updated, the url is updated based on the routes.</p>

<p>This means that routes in volt have to go both from url to params and params to url.  It should also be noted that if a link is clicked and the controller/view to render the new url is within the current component (or an included component), the page will not be reloaded, the url will be updated with the HTML5 history API, and the params hash will reflect the new url.  You can use the changes in params to render different views based on the url.</p>

<h2>Routes file</h2>

<p>Routes are specified on a per-component basis in the config/routes.rb file.  Routes simply map from url to params.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    get &quot;/todos&quot;, _view: &#39;todos&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>Routes take two arguments, a path, and a params hash.  When a new url is loaded and the path is matched on a route, the params will be set to the params provided for that route.</p>

<p>When the params are changed, the url will be set to the path for the route that&#39;s params hash matches.</p>

<p>Route path&#39;s can also contain variables similar to bindings.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>    get &quot;/todos/{"&#123;"}_index{38.chr + "#125;"}&quot;, _view: &#39;todos&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>In the case above, if any url matches /todos/*, (where * is anything but a slash), it will be the active route. <code>params._view</code> would be set to &#39;todos&#39;, and <code>params._index</code> would be set to the value in the path.</p>

<p>If <code>params._view</code> is &#39;todos&#39; and <code>params._index</code> is not nil, the route would be matched.</p>

<p>Routes are matched top to bottom in a routes file.</p>

<h2>Debugging</h2>

<p>An in browser irb is in the works.  We also have source maps support, but they are currently disabled due by default.  To enable them run:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-ruby'><code>MAPS=true volt s
</code></pre>

<p>They are disabled by default because they slow down page rendering because so many files are rendered.  We&#39;re working with the opal and sprockets teams to make it so everything is still served in one big source maps file (which would show the files as they originated on disk)</p>

<h2>Channel</h2>

<p>Controllers provide a .channel method, that you can use to get the status of the connection to the backend.  Channel is provided in a ReactiveValue, and when the status changes, the changed events are triggered.  It provides the following:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>method</th>
<th>description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>connected?</td>
<td>true if it is connected to the backend</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>status</td>
<td>possible values: :opening, :open, :closed, :reconnecting</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>error</td>
<td>the error message for the last failed connection</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>retry_count</td>
<td>the number of reconnection attempts that have been made without a successful connection</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>reconnect_interval</td>
<td>the time until the next reconnection attempt (in seconds)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
